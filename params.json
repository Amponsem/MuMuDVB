{"name":"Mumudvb","tagline":"A DVB IPTV streaming software","body":"MuMuDVB (Multi Multicast DVB) is a program for streaming TV over a network originally based on dvbstream.\r\n\r\nMuMuDVB can redistribute a stream from a DVB source (digital satellite television, digital terrestrial television, or digital cable television) on a network, in multicast or in HTTP unicast. Its main feature is to take a whole transponder and put each channel on a different multicast group. MuMuDVB have a low memory and CPU footprint and is able to run on embedded platforms. RTSP streaming will be implemented in a near future.\r\n\r\nMuMuDVB works under linux and uses the linux DVB API.

It scales to a larger receiver population by not requiring prior knowledge of who or how many receivers there are. Multicast utilizes network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers only where necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the main web site [MuMuDVB main website](http://mumudvb.braice.net)","google":"UA-41389486-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
