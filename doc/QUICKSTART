Quickstart guide for mumudvb
----------------------------

It this guide I'll explain how to stream a full transponder (all the channels
multiplexed on the same carrier frequency) over a network, by assigning each
channel to a different multicast IP. The sap announces will automatically be generated.

I'll take an example for DVB-S (satellite) and DVB-T (terrestrial)

I suppose you have one DVB card wich is already working, if you have more than
one card refer to the full doc.

= DVB-s =

 * First install mumudvb
  * type "make" in the mumudvb directory and, as root, "make install"

 * You have to find wich transponder you want to stream.
  * For European users you can use http://www.kingofsat.net/
  * You need : the frequency, the polarisation and the symbol rate (srate)

 * Now create a config file, wich contains : 

"""
autoconfiguration=2
freq=__tranponder frequency in MHz__
pol=__polarisation H or V__
srate=__symbol rate__
"""

Example : 

"""
autoconfiguration=2
freq=11785
pol=h
srate=27500
"""

 * Now launch mumudvb with :
	"""mumudvb -d -c __path to config file__""

 * That's all, you should get a list of the streamed channels with their IP
adress

 * The SAP (session announcement protocol) announces will be sent automatically

= DVB-t =

 * It's the same way as DVB-s excepted that you need other informations for
tuning your card.
You can find these informations in : 
"/usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples/scan/dvb-t/" if you installed the dvb-utils
package

Your config file will be : 
"""
autoconfiguration=2
freq=__frequency in kHz__
"""

If your bandwith is different from 8Mhz or if you experience tuning issues,
look for the following parameters in README_CONF : bandwidth, qam, trans_mode,
guardinterval, coderate

 * The SAP (session announcement protocol) announces will be sent automatically

= Troubleshooting =

 * Try adding -v to the mumudvb command line to have more detailled messages
 * If you experience tuning issues, try with other dvb software like scan or
szap and check your parameters
 * If it still don't work, look at common issues in the README and you can
write a mail at mumudvb _AT_ braice _DOT_ net or 
"mumudvb-dev _AT_ lists DOT crans DOT org"
