This is a modified version of scan from dbv-apps : http://linuxtv.org/
The original version can be found here : http://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.1.tar.gz

This new version is able to write his output in the format asked by mumudvb. You just have to add the "-o mumudvb" parameter on the command line

For example if you want to scan the card 0 (already tuned with zap for example) for Free to Air channel and put the results in card0.conf 
"scan -a 0 -o mumudvb -c -x 0 > card0.conf"

Notes :
  * you have to add the card parameter and check the Ip adresses
